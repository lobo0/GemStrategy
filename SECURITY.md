# 🔒 GemStrategy Security Checklist

This document outlines security best practices and checklist items for deploying the GemStrategy application.

## 🚨 Critical Security Items

### ✅ Environment Variables
- [ ] **Never commit `.env` files** to version control
- [ ] **Use strong, unique secrets** for each environment
- [ ] **Rotate secrets regularly** (every 90 days)
- [ ] **Limit secret access** to only necessary personnel

### ✅ API Security
- [ ] **HTTPS enabled** on all endpoints
- [ ] **Input validation** implemented for all user inputs
- [ ] **Rate limiting** configured to prevent abuse
- [ ] **CORS policies** properly configured
- [ ] **Error messages** don't expose sensitive information

### ✅ Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] **JWT tokens** properly secured (if implemented)
- [ ] **Session management** secure
- [ ] **Password policies** enforced (if user auth added)
- [ ] **Multi-factor authentication** enabled (if applicable)

## 🛡️ Deployment Security

### Vercel
- [ ] **Environment variables** set in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] **Team access** limited to necessary members
- [ ] **Deployment protection** enabled
- [ ] **Preview deployments** secured

### Google Cloud Platform
- [ ] **Service account keys** not committed to repository
- [ ] **IAM roles** follow principle of least privilege
- [ ] **VPC firewall rules** properly configured
- [ ] **Cloud Armor** enabled for DDoS protection

## 🔐 Secrets Management

### What Should NEVER Be Committed
```bash
# ❌ NEVER commit these files:
.env
.env.local
.env.production
.env.staging
secrets.json
service-account-*.json
*.key
*.pem
*.crt
*.p12
id_rsa
id_rsa.pub
```

### What Should Be Committed
```bash
# ✅ Safe to commit:
.env.example
config_package/settings.py (without secrets)
vercel.json (without secrets)
app.yaml (without secrets)
```

## 🚪 Access Control

- [ ] **Performance metrics** tracked

### Log Security
- [ ] **Logs don't contain** sensitive information
- [ ] **Log access** restricted and audited
- [ ] **Log retention** policies implemented
- [ ] **Log encryption** enabled

## 🔍 Security Testing

### Automated Testing
- [ ] **Security scans** run on each deployment
- [ ] **Dependency vulnerability** checks enabled
- [ ] **Code quality** tools configured
- [ ] **Static analysis** for security issues

### Manual Testing
- [ ] **Penetration testing** performed regularly
